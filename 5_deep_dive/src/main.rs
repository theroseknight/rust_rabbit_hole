    let _x: i32 = 5;  //Rust will infer the standard types you are used to like string, integer, etc but you can also explicitly define the type using x: type =

    //All rust programs (not libraries) have to have the fn main() {}.  This is the function that is called when you cargo run --release.  As we saw in rust
    //inside other languages when creating a library pub extern fn process() {} you can name the function anything you want because you will tie the function name
    //to a function name used in your importing language like rust or node.js.  The main function can access functions defined at the same scope level as main.

    //Functions are practically identical to Javascript except the keyword is fn intead of function and you MUST define a type on each argument just like
    //bindings(minus the optional part).  fn print_sum(x,y) {} would cause an error
    fn print_sum_one(x: i32, y: i32) {
        println!("sum is: {}", x + y);
    }

    print_sum_one(5,50);

    //The above is a function that does something and has no return. The below is a function thats purpose is to return something back.  Note that just like the
    //arguments you must define a type for the return value.

    //First thing to note is just like ruby, rust automatically returns the last expression.  Second is that your expression MUST NOT end with a ;. Doing so will
    //convert your expression into a statement which in rust returns nothing thereby defeating the automatic return.

    //Rust has two kinds of statements and everything else in the language is an expression

    //First is a the declaration statement.  Setting somethign equal to a declaration statement: let g = (y=6) will not return 6 it will return the empty tuple ()
    //The second is an expression statement. An expression followed by a semicolon turns that expression into a statement.  Rust expects your program to be read as
    //as a series of consecutively exectued statements.  This is why you see a semicolon after every expression with the sole exception of the expression that you
    //intend to return from a function.
    //Summary: the expression x + 1 returns the value of x + 1 while the declaration statement x + 1; returns an empty tuple ()

    //This function demonstrate how you would return a statement instead of a semicolonless expression to write more natural (from an OOP perspective) rust fn's
    //This also demonstrates that you can ignore the implicit return functionality of rust just like I do with ruby and explicity return values using the return
    //keyword which makes me happy
    fn print_sum_three(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
        let test = x + y +  1;

    //Using a return as the last line of a function works, but is considered poor style: <--- Straight from the Learn Rust book.  I would like to take a moment to
    //say fuck you.

    // 3) Integer - Holy shit this got complicated quickly compared to JavaSript and Ruby.

        // L) f64   Gives 15-17 digits of precision and is over a million times more accurate.  Hasn't killed people as far as I can tell.  Use this one always.

    // 4) Array  let mut m = [1,2,3] - Arrays in rust are immutable by default and have to have mut called if you intend to use it as a changing container

    let a = [1,2,3];

       //Slices take on the form of &name_of_thing[]
    let a = [0,1,2,3,4];

    // 6) str - circle back on this after learning about references and unsized types as it seems its never really used semicolon.
        //for now just know that if you want to pass a string as an arugment its type should be &str

    // 7) tuples - an ordered list of fixed size using () as the container (commonly seen as the arguments to a function). Can take multiple types in same tuple
    let _x: (i32, &str) = (1, "hello");  //explicitly set type
    let _y = (2, "world");               //let rust implicity determine the type
